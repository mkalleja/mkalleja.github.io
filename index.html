        <h3> publishing the page</h3>
        <p> to publish it, we need a server, who will host our webpage.</p>
        <p> we will use the plattform "GitHub" to store our projects free of charge. It was formerly an open source project, now it belongs to microsoft. It is seen as the most important website to store sourccode.</p>
        <img src="puppy.jpg" style="width:500px;"> 
        <p> you put an image using the "img"-tag and source tag "src" followed by = and the name of the image</p>
        <p> we change the width of the image by adding "style="width:500px;" in the img-tag</p>
        <img src="puppy2.jpg" style="width:500px;">
        <img src="puppy3.webp" style="width:500px;"> 
    <p> playing around with the layout is not as easy. We use bootstrap to oour code. </p>
